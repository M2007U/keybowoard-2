# 🎹 KeybOwOard - 2D version // Computer Keyboard 2D Lattice Music Keyboard
This keyboard is the derivation of the 1D-12EDO-version.
This is heavily inspired by Microtone Music and a video from LampLight.
This will work on your computer keyboard

# 💡 Main Idea
one layout settings allow you to have the following trait :<br>
Every time you go left and right, the frequency will get multiplied or divided by some constant.<br>
Every time you go up and down, the frequency will get multiplied or divided by another constant.<br>

  # 🪴 Process and BackStory
  This is a derivation of KeybOwOard-12-EDO , after watching Caftaphata by LampLight,
  XR_XharpRazor decided to create this keyboard to achieve the Chalaxata *(grid , lattice layout)*
  As time goes by, more and more features are added *(eg: works in EDO rather than factors only)*
